	  <p><em>This talk was originally delivered at the NZAS
	  conference in April 2012.</em></p>
	  
	  <p>When we ask if emerging scientists have a future in New
	  Zealand I think we're really asking a few separate, but
	  related questions. I sometimes wonder, especially in the
	  context of a conference like this, if we're making implicit
	  assumptions about the answer to each of them, so I'm going
	  to try to separate them out and answer them
	  individually. First, we're asking if emerging scientists
	  actually want a future in New Zealand. Assuming they do,
	  we're asking if they can actually have a future
	  here. Finally, we're asking how we can help to make it
	  happen.</p>

	  <p>We can ask those questions in a couple of different
	  ways. We can ask if, in terms of public policy, we want
	  emerging scientists to have a future in New Zealand, if can
	  we make that happen, and how to ensure it happens. We can
	  also ask those same questions on a personal level. Do
	  emerging scientists, like you or I, actually want a future
	  here? And if so, can we make it happen?</p>

	  <p>Let's talk public policy for a minute. I'm sure that at
	  some point today someone has presented a set of numbers and
	  figures to the effect that an emerging scientist is a public
	  good; each additional scientist in New Zealand confers some
	  large (but hard to measure) benefit to the country as a
	  whole. I'm sure they also provided evidence that the cost of
	  convincing scientists to stay is much less than the
	  return. If you haven't heard that here today, then you will
	  have heard it elsewhere. Paul Callaghan, for example,
	  discussed this extensively in Wool to Weta
	  [<a href="#fn:1">1</a>]. I don't disagree. Numbers never
	  lie. However, one thing I rarely hear discussed is the
	  opportunity cost. Scientists are smart people, and they
	  would be smart people even if they weren't scientists. When
	  we convince someone to work in the basic sciences we're also
	  convincing them not to work on something else. What, I
	  wonder, are we giving up?</p>

	  <p>I don't have an answer to that. It's just a thought.</p>

	  <p>What I actually want to discuss today is the personal
	  side of all this. So you understand where I'm coming from
	  I'm going to tell you a bit about myself. I was born in
	  South Africa and moved here when I was nine. I grew up in a
	  town called Whakatane and moved to Wellington for
	  university. I stayed for a PhD and then moved to Boston
	  University to do a postdoc. Last year I quit my job and
	  moved back here to start a company.</p>

	  <p>Technically that probably means I'm not an emerging
	  scientist anymore, but I do know what it's like to leave New
	  Zealand, and what it's like to return. Also, I am working in
	  a related field. Let me tell you a little about my company,
	  Publons [<a href="#fn:2">2</a>]. Basically, we scientists
	  prove our value with what we publish. A good publication
	  record is the bedrock for any job or grant application. I'm
	  sure you all agree that system is not perfect but, like
	  democracy, it's the least bad system we've tried. Actually
	  that's not true. We haven't tried any other systems. The
	  basic technology we use to publish and review scientific
	  research hasn't really changed in the three hundred plus
	  years since the Royal Society started the first journal.</p>

	  <p>Publons is an attempt to change that. It's an experiment
	  at allowing you to rate, review, and discuss any publication
	  in any journal in one place, and an attempt to decouple your
	  reputation as a scientist from journals and journal
	  articles. I want to emphasize the experimental part of this
	  project. We really are trying to approach this as a way to
	  test a hypothesis. I doubt that would come naturally to me
	  without a background in science. In that sense it's an
	  example of how it's possible to do science without doing
	  "science".</p>

	  <p>Anyway, publons.com. Please take a look. If you have any
	  thoughts or suggestions then I'd love to hear them.</p>

	  <p>Ok, with that out of the way, let's get back to the
	  original question: do emerging scientists want a future in
	  New Zealand. I don't, not particularly. New Zealand is a
	  beautiful place, and Wellington is a great city. My family
	  is here and a lot of my friends are here; I'll always spend
	  time here. However, New Zealand is a beautiful place in a
	  world full of beautiful places, and Wellington is a great
	  city in a world that contains Copenhagen, Barcelona, Cape
	  Town, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, New York, Shanghai,
	  London, and Tokyo. In an ideal world I'd get to experience
	  living in all of those places. And in a log cabin in the
	  mountains of Montana.</p>

	  <p>However, I'm willing to accept that I'm in the
	  minority. A good friend of mine just moved here because he
	  fell for Wellington during a visit. I work with some people
	  that moved back here from Hong Kong specifically because
	  they wanted to live in Wellington. There seem to be a lot of
	  emerging scientists that do want a future in New
	  Zealand.</p>

	  <p>My only point is that it's up to you to decide on your
	  future. It's ok to want to leave, and it's ok to want to
	  stay.</p>

	  <p>For those of you that want to stay, can you? If science
	  is your priority then the answer is probably no. My
	  postdoctoral work focused on soft x-ray
	  spectroscopy. Basically, that means I shot x-rays at various
	  materials and looked at what came out. To do that you need a
	  synchrotron, which is basically a particle accelerator, and
	  costs on the order of 100 million dollars to build. I could
	  not have come back to New Zealand if I'd wanted to keep
	  doing that.</p>

	  <p>There is no chance you'll ever be able to do that kind of
	  science in New Zealand. Nor is it likely that we'll attract
	  many superstars. If you want to be surrounded by the very
	  best scientists and students then you need to be in Boston,
	  or the Bay Area, or somewhere like that. I'm sure that
	  there's been plenty of talk about virtual networks today,
	  but you can't beat physical presence.</p>

	  <p>However, the answer is also yes. If staying in New
	  Zealand is your priority then there are plenty of things you
	  can do here. I'm not going to list them; I trying to make a
	  more general point. If we want to claim that we are
	  brilliant scientists, capable of pushing forward the
	  boundaries of human knowledge, then surely we are also
	  capable of finding a way to stay in New Zealand. There's
	  been a lot of talk today about how we need help from
	  businesses, universities, and government. If you really want
	  to stay in New Zealand then perhaps you should ignore that
	  and figure it out for yourself. You might not have the same
	  choices of what to work on, but it's certainly possible.</p>

	  <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that's easy.</p>

	  <p>I'll never forget what it was like to wake up in the days
	  after quitting my postdoc. There is nothing you have to do;
	  you're completely free to do whatever you want. No boss, no
	  papers to write, no requirements. Sounds great, right? It's
	  actually terrifying. What I've come to realize is that
	  freedom is a scary thing. Having a job, a PhD to complete, a
	  talk to present, these things give you validation.</p>

	  <p>A couple of years ago William Deresiewicz gave a talk to
	  the plebe class at West Point. The title was "Solitude and
	  Leadership" [<a href="#fn:3">3</a>]. The transcript is
	  definitely worth reading; you'll find it in The American
	  Scholar. In it he makes the case that leadership is not
	  about being popular with people, but that leadership is
	  about setting a course that is true to what you believe;
	  it's about solitude.</p>

	  <p>The thing is that as we've trained to become expert
	  scientists we've also trained to become experts at meeting
	  the requirements of a bureaucracy. We go to school and learn
	  how to pass tests. We graduate and learn how to get papers
	  accepted into journals. We start working and learn how to
	  write funding proposals.</p>

	  <p>I wonder if we shouldn't also try to train leaders,
	  people that can imagine something beyond the
	  bureaucracy. Maybe that sort of creative thinking is what
	  New Zealand needs most of all.</p>

	  <p>Thanks.</p>
